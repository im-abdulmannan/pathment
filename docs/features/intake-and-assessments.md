# Intake & Assessments

**What it is:** the self-serve admissions pipeline - a public program catalog, shareable
cohort apply links, applications with admin review, admin-built assessments of any type, and
the accept → invite → register → placement flow. Whatever's collected up front **carries
forward** so the mentee never re-types it.

**Why it exists:** intake used to be spreadsheets + Forms + manual invites. This turns
"recruit → assess → place" into one structured, idempotent flow.

## Data model
`Cohort` (a program's intake season; `status planning→open→closed→running→completed`, plus
`publicSlug`, `publicEnabled`, apply window/cap, `intakeFormSchema`, `assessmentId`,
`assessmentRequired`). `Application` (free-form `responses` JSONB, `status`, `assessmentScore`,
`accessTokenHash` magic-link, `inviteId`, `userId`). `Assessment` + `AssessmentQuestion`
(mcq / multi_select / short_text / long_text / file_upload / external_link) +
`AssessmentSubmission` (answers, auto/manual/total score). `RegistrationInvite` carries the
placement. See migration 031/043.

## Backend
- **Public (`/api/public`, no auth):** `GET /programs`, `GET /programs/:id`, `GET /cohorts/:slug` (apply info), `POST /cohorts/:slug/apply`, `GET /applications/:token` (status + sanitized assessment), `POST /applications/:token/assessment`, `POST /applications/:token/upload`.
- **Admin intake (`/api/intake`, `intake.manage`):** cohort CRUD, `public-link` enable/disable, `clone-intake`, get-or-create `assessment`, application list/import/detail/accept/reject, `assessment-submissions/:id/grade`.
- **Assessment authoring (`/api/assessments`, `assessment.author`):** CRUD + `PUT /:id/questions`.
- **Services:** `publicIntakeService` (catalog, apply, magic-link, auto-grade), `assessmentService` (authoring + grading + sanitize), `cohortIntakeService` (cohorts, public link, clone), `applicationService` (review, accept). Auto-grades MCQs on submit; correct answers are never sent to applicants. Carry-forward: `config/intakeProfileFields.js` maps application answers → User/MenteeProfile at register, auto-completing onboarding.

## Frontend
- **Public:** `app/(public)/programs` (catalog), `/programs/[id]`, `/apply/[slug]` (form builder fields), `/apply/status/[token]` (status + assessment runner, all question types incl. file upload).
- **Admin:** `/admin/cohorts` + `/admin/cohorts/[id]` (public-link panel, form builder, attach/create assessment, applicant review with submission + grading, live preview); `/admin/assessments` + `/admin/assessments/[id]` (assessment library + builder).

## Role flows
- **Applicant (no account):** browse `/programs` or open a cohort link → fill the form (name/email + admin-configured fields) → get an emailed magic link → take the assessment if required → track status.
- **Admin / Intake manager:** create a cohort → build the application form + attach/create an assessment → enable the public link (or import a CSV) → review applications (see answers + assessment + score) → **Accept** (issues an invite placing them into a program + optional clan) or reject. Can **clone** a previous cohort's setup.
- **Mentee (after accept):** registers via the invite; their intake answers are already on their profile (onboarding pre-filled).

## Rules & edge cases
- A link only accepts applications while the cohort is `open`, inside its window, and under its cap.
- One application per (cohort, email); re-applying resumes a pending one; decided ones are locked. Existing-user emails are told to log in.
- MCQ/multi-select auto-grade; text/file/link need manual grading; `assessmentScore` mirrors onto the application.
- The standalone Assessments library lets you reuse an assessment across cohorts.
